# Full Stack Architecture

This repo contains both backend and frontend.

## Backend

- entry point: src/backend/index.ts
- stack: nodejs, fastify

## Frontend

All frontend dependencies should be `devDependencies` so a user can install this package and serve the provided ui bundle without needing to install those deps.

- entry point: src/frontend/index.tsx
- stack: vite, react, shadcn/ui, lucide, tailwind, zustand, dnd-kit, vitest with playwright
